# i3config
i3 WM config file with adjustments. All the changes to the original code are at the begining of the file.

The idea of this repo is to help new users of i3 learn the possibilities of making it your own, so any contribution in that regard are welcome. That being said, the modifications are very biased to my own likings.

## Before using it
Review the file of the repo to check for your preferences, for packages not installed, that your monitor configurations are correct, etc.
You can modify it after, but checking it before will spare surprises in the first load of the settings.

## How to use it
1. Backup your file `~/home/user/.config/i3/config` if you have any.
2. Replace it with `config` from this repo.
3. Use the hotkey ***Shift + $mod + r*** so i3 reloads the configuration file.

NOT MANTAINED ANYMORE. I'M MOVING TO SWAY (WAYLAND). I'LL PUBLISH ABOUT THAT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.

# i3config

i3 WM config file with adjustments. All changes to the original code are located at the beginning of the file.

This repository is meant to help new users of i3 understand how to customize it. Any suggestions are welcome. However, the changes are influenced by my own preferences.

## Before using it

Review the file of the repo to check for your preferences, for packages not installed, that your monitor configurations are correct, etc.
You can modify it after, but checking it before will spare surprises in the first load of the settings.

## How to use it

### Override your current settings:

1. Backup your file `~/home/user/.config/i3/config` if you have any.
2. Replace it with `config` from this repo.
3. Use the hotkey ***Shift + $mod + r*** so i3 reloads the configuration file.

### Combine it with your current settings:

You can add to your current config file the specific modifications that you find interesting in this repo. 
Be sure to avoid duplicated instructions.
